# akmey-install
Automated install script (at least, if it's working).

## Use
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akmey/akmey-install/master/install.sh
less install.sh
bash install.sh
```

Or, in a less secure manner:
```
bash <(curl -Ss https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akmey/akmey-install/master/install.sh)
```
